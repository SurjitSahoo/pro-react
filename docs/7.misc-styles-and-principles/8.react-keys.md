# Keys for React Elements

In JSX loops don't use random values such as `Math.random()` or the item index as the key of the item.

If you're filtering an array and using `Array.map()` to create UI elements, if the filter condition changes, you might get the same elements but with different indices. React will see it as a brand-new item because the key has changed. Always use a value that is unique to the element, such as a unique ID from database.
