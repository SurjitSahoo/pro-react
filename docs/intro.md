# Why Code Quality Matters

Bad code is a technical debt. We will have to pay for it eventually. It'll get harder and harder to maintain in the long run. And you'll get
to a point where adding more developers has diminishing returns. Insufficient design for any piece of code will remove its ability to
change, scale, or to be re-used. But change is inevitable, it'll always happen, It needs to happen. And change relies on existing code's
ability to scale. Good architecture solves these problems.
