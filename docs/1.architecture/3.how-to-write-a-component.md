# How to write a component

Each component should be as generic as possible. Avoid implementing components that are tightly coupled to specific business features or requirements. While you may initially build a component to fulfill a particular business need, that's just the starting point. After implementing the feature, refactor your code by extracting and splitting it into smaller, more focused components. Continue extracting and splitting until until you cannot extract or split the code any further.

These smaller components should be designed for maximum reusability, making them easy to use in different scenarios. This approach improves maintainability and scalability across your projects.

:::note
Write once, reuse everywhere.
:::

Every component should be placed in its own folder. This folder should contain all code related to that component, including:

- The main component file
- Test files
- Styles (CSS/SCSS, etc.)
- Storybook files (if any)
- Helper files (with their own tests). If there are multiple helpers, group them in a `helpers` folder.

Helpers are typically needed at the feature level. This is because your components will often require input in a different data structure than what you receive from the API, and they may also output data in a format different from what your API expects. Therefore, you will likely need helper functions to transform data between these formats.
