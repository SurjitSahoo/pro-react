But the folder structure is the highest level structure we see about an application. Hence the folder structure of an application should describe the overall structure of the application. Folder structure will differ application to application as all applications are different, just like floor plan blueprint of buildings vary building to building as all buildings / houses are different.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture/how-to-write-a-component":{"id":"architecture/how-to-write-a-component","title":"How to Write a Component","description":"Each component should be as generic as possible. Avoid creating components that are tightly coupled to specific business features or requirements. While you may initially build a component to address a particular business need, treat that as a starting point. After implementing the feature, refactor your code by extracting and splitting it into smaller, more focused components. Continue this process until you cannot extract or split the code any further.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture/open-close-principle-and-the-role-of-agile":{"id":"architecture/open-close-principle-and-the-role-of-agile","title":"Open Close Principle and the Role of Agile","description":"Open Close Principle","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture/separation-of-concerns":{"id":"architecture/separation-of-concerns","title":"Separation of Concerns","description":"React is the antithesis of this principle.

For example, if you fetch data in TABA, switch to TABB to fetch different data, and then quickly return to TAB_A, you typically don\'t need to refetch the data again if it hasn\'t changed. Instead, reuse the cached data and render the content. If necessary, refetch it in the background and only update the UI if the data has changed; otherwise, continue displaying the cached data.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"architecture/state-management/context-can-be-dangerous":{"id":"architecture/state-management/context-can-be-dangerous","title":"React Context is Dangerous","description":"Context is not a replacement for global state.
